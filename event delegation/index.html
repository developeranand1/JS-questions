<body>
    <p>Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element instead of adding event listeners to multiple child elements individually. This works because of event bubbling, where an event triggered on a child element bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM.

        Why use event delegation?
        Improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners.
        
        Works for dynamically added elements, which might not exist when the event listeners are first attached.
        
        How it works:
        Attach a listener to a parent element.
        
        Inside the event handler, use event.target to check which child triggered the event.
        
        Apply logic conditionally based on the target.</p>
    <div id="parent">
        <button class="item">one</button>
        <button class="item">two</button>
        <button class="item">three</button>
        <button class="item">4</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        console.log("Event Delegation");

        document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener("click",function(e){
            if(e.target && e.target.matches('button.item')){
                console.log("Button Clicked ",e.target.textContent);
            }
        })
    </script>
